# Web_Programming_I_Final
Final project submission for web programming I
This uses a tutorial to make a logo for one image (tutorial for logo making is Logos by Nick: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCaTXvJE4X8), and uses ASMR's programming tutorial for a tile matching game with modifications (source here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R51QkU6AXRE). The headers and formats are from CDN's from Bootstrap.

The purpose of this project was to display knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS that would be associated with making a website.
There are 6 HTML pages: login, contact, discount, welcome, faq, and history.
